# ADC Module

This module is an 8 channel 8 bit ADC. It uses a 74HC(T)688 comparator for address decoding meaning you can assign it to any 8-bit window of IO address space and it will only decode at that address.

The schematic, BOM and gerbers are all available, and there is a test program in the BASIC folder to help you get started.

You can order the boards directly from OSHPark
